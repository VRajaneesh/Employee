# Git Workflow Decision Document

## Why Use a Git Workflow?
A clear git workflow helps teams work together smoothly, avoid mistakes, and keep the main code safe. It makes it easy to add new features, fix bugs, and review changes before they go live.

## Options Considered
- **Feature Branch Workflow**
- **Git Flow**
- **Trunk-Based Development**

## Why Feature Branch Workflow Was Chosen
- **Simple to Use:** Each new feature or fix gets its own branch. This is easy for everyone to understand.
- **Keeps Main Code Safe:** Changes are made in separate branches and only merged when ready, so the main branch is always stable.
- **Good for Small Teams:** Works well for projects with a few developers. No need for complex rules.
- **Easy Collaboration:** Team members can work on different features at the same time without conflicts.
- **Clear History:** Each branch shows what was changed and why, making it easy to track progress.

## How the Workflow Works
1. Create a new branch for each feature or bug fix (e.g., `feature/login`, `bugfix/search-error`).
2. Do your work in the branch. Commit changes as you go.
3. When finished, test your changes and make sure everything works.
4. Merge the branch into the main branch (usually called `main` or `master`).
5. Delete the feature branch after merging to keep things tidy.

## Why Not Git Flow or Trunk-Based?
- **Git Flow:** Good for big teams and complex projects, but has more rules and branches to manage. Can be confusing for small teams.
- **Trunk-Based:** Fast and simple, but needs strong testing and may not be best for teams new to git or working on bigger features.

## Summary
Feature Branch Workflow is the best fit for this Employee Directory app. It is simple, safe, and helps the team work together without problems. It keeps the main code stable and makes it easy to add new features or fixes.

## Quick Guide: How to Use Feature Branch Workflow

1. Start from the main branch (`main`).
2. Create a new branch for your task (e.g., `feature/add-login`).
3. Do your work and commit changes to your branch.
4. Push your branch to the remote repository.
5. When finished, open a pull request to merge your branch into `main`.
6. Review and test your changes.
7. Merge the branch into `main` after approval.
8. Delete your feature branch after merging to keep things tidy.

This keeps your main code safe and makes teamwork easy!
